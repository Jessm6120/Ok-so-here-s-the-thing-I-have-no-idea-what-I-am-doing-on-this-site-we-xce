someone who knows what they are doing I have
no idea how to work this website or do 
anything else on it, but the one thing that 
I have come to do is to find out if 
puppeteer or pipeteer is a requirement on 
a phone or a tablet or device. and I found 
out that it is not a requirement and I've 
seen it on my daughters my 7 year old 
daughter's tablet her Google Amazon fire 
tablet two or three nights ago and I've 
been seeing it on every single device 
I've had since I was before I had her so 
I signed up to be a Google beta tester 
didn't know what I was getting myself into to
be honest with you still don't and I wish 
I would have never done it but I can't take 
it back now I have removed myself from all 
those Google better beta testing whatever's
and anyways can someone please help me 
remove puppeteer puppeteer any kind of
thing like that from my Android device 
devices her tablets everything please help

born that's the year puppeteer came out it
